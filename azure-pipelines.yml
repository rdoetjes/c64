# C64 KickAss build and deploy pipeline
# Requirements:
# - Private Build agent, my pool is called Pi4 (change to your pool name)
#     -DevOps agent should be installed in /home/pi/agent
# - On build agent host you will need:
#       -KickAssembler needs to be installed in /usr/local/bin (download the KickAss.zip unzip and upload to /usr/local/bin)
#       -java installed to run kickassembler jar (sudo apt install default-jre)
#       -lftp needs to be installed (sudo apt get lftp) this is because FtpUpload task uses a command that is unrecognized in UltimateII
# - A variable group called c64 needs to be created containing the following variables:
#     -variable ftpusername containing the UltimateII user name (usually root)
#     -variable ftppassword containing the UltimateII user name's password (usually empty)
#     -variable ftphost containing the UltimateII ip address or hostname

trigger: none

variables:
  - group: c64  #variable group containing the ftp related variables and values

pool:
  name: Pi4     #the private pool running on Pi4 (any linux private pool on the same network as UltimateII cardridge will work)
